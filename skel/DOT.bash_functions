# mkcd creates a directory hierarchy, then cds into it all in one
# swell foop. To use it in your shell, run it as:
# . /path/mkcd
# That will execute it without launching a new shell, so that it
# changes your current shell's environment.
# You can then use the function in scripts or from the terminal to
# create a new directory or directory hierarchy, and cd into it. E.g:
#
# mkcd foo/bar/baz

function mkcd

dir=$1;
mkdir -p $dir && cd $dir;
